        <p>
            
            Osaka feels like a second home to me. I spent part of my childhood there, going to elementary school and enjoying long recesses. We kids would help out by cleaning and serving lunch, which was fun and made us feel responsible.<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Osaka is famous for its amazing food, earning the nickname 'Kitchen of Japan.' My favorite dishes are Takoyaki and Kushikatsu. Takoyaki are delicious balls filled with octopus and topped with a tasty sauce. Kushikatsu is even better - it's meat, seafood, and vegetables on skewers, all deep-fried and served with a special sauce. Yum!<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While lots of people visit Osaka for Dotonbori, a lively area known for its street food and the big Glico Running Man sign, my favorite place is Shinsekai. It's a bit old-school, with fun arcades where you can play games like Smartball, similar to Pachinko, and win prizes. Shinsekai also has lots of Kushikatsu restaurants and the famous Tsutenkaku Tower. I spent a lot of time there last summer, and I think the arcades in Japan have a special vibe that you can't find in the US.
