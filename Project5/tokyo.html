    <p style="padding-inline: 60px;">Tokyo, Japan's capital, is one of the biggest cities in the world. It's a place where new meets old, offering everything from modern sights to traditional spots. Shibuya is one of the most famous areas here. Last summer, the biggest Twitch streamer, Kai Cennat, visited Tokyo, and my friends got to meet him. I even bumped into his friend Ray at a sneaker shop, which was pretty cool. Shibuya is known for its super busy crosswalk, which feels like a sea of people crossing from all directions. It's a must-see for anyone visiting.

        Another spot I loved was Harajuku. It's famous for its unique fashion and the place where crepes became a big hit. You'll find all sorts of cool and quirky shops here. Just watch out for some odd scam stores tucked away in alleys. I found a new favorite fashion brand in Harajuku called AAPE, known for its hip-hop vibe and a cute monkey logo.
        
        For those into Japan's history and culture, you can't miss Meiji Jingu and Asakusa. Asakusa is home to Senso-ji, Tokyo's most famous temple. It's surrounded by old shops and is a great place to pick up an Omikuji, a fortune slip that tells you about your future.
        
        Tokyo is a city that has it all â€“ from the latest in fashion and tech to deep historical roots. It's definitely a city worth exploring.</p>
