    <p>
        Tomoyoshiâ„¢ was born in 2004 and was a really fun kid. He loved running outside, playing with Beyblades and Thomas the Train, and played soccer during the weekends. In high school, he was searching online on YouTube for technology videos when he stumbled upon a channel called Linus Tech Tips. He then developed a passion for everything technology.

        During COVID, there was a chip shortage, and Tomoyoshi would camp overnight at tech stores to get the latest graphics cards and technologies. He then found interest in building his own computer and explored everything people could do with computers, trying out crypto mining, gaming, etc.

        By the time he finished high school, he was ready to go to college to continue his education. He was still young at the time, so he wasn't exactly sure what to study. He decided to attend <strong>Syracuse University</strong> as an undecided student focusing on economics, as the study of money interested him. But while he was at university, he found out about the iSchool and rediscovered his passion for technology he once had. He is now studying information studies and management at Syracuse University.
